# Web-Scraper-Quotes

This project implements an interactive quote viewer, consisting of famous quotes and the names of their speakers, scraped from a blog. 

Python is used to implement the web scraper and the raw HTML data scraped is parsed using the BeautifulSoup library.

A JavaScript script is used to implement the interactive frontend through buttons able to scroll through the quotes.
